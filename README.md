# docket-analysis

This code was meant for my own use, so it's messy. I'm also not a programmer, so this was designed for journalistic purposes-- tips to improve always welcome. 

It's designed to snag meaningful data from Dockets Justicia on prison litigation including civil rights cases and prison conditions. I was looking not only to make a data set of all relevant data, but also keep a counter on which states/defendants pop up the most. 

It's a pipe delimited file.
